INTRODUCTION

Two sites from OSSM (Oregon shelf Surface Mooring) and from OOSM (Oregon Offshore Surface Mooring) will have data recorded of wind speed and precipitation. From this two different location, the goal would be to determine whether the two location will have some correlation which is necessary for weather purposes. If the other site experiences this much wind speed, does that mean the other site will have the same wind? Similar experiment will be done for rain rate or precipitation at two different locations.

5. After plotting cross corellation function between wind speed at both sides, what is the highest correlation? WHat is the time lag?
The highest correlation is .727 with a time lag of 2.  A pretty high correlation between the wind speed at two different location means that the data recorded from OSSM and OOSM is well corellated. Meaning that if a high wind from the ocean coming from offshore is recorded, a similar data will also be recorded for the Shelf or on the other side but with a lag of 2.

6. After plotting the cross correlation function betweeen rain rate at both sides, what is the highest correlation? What is the time lag?
Plotting a cross corelation function between rain rate at two different location, the max correlation only went up to .357 with a lag of 56. different spikes were also protrayed at different locations, meaning that it does match on some other months but it would be hard to say that theres some correlation. Lag is also counted to be 20days betweeen these two different location. Looking at the weather we currently experience, there are so many times when it is raining or snow hard at a different location but dry at a location miles away. On the other hand, the wind would blow with a speed (sometimes a storm) and travel through far distances.

7. Is there any relationship between the time lag of wind speed and rain rate?

There is no relationship between the time lag of wind speed and rain rate according to the data recorded. For wind velocity at different location, it makes sense for the wind to keep travelling through at further distance, hence, the lag make sense that it doesnt take days. However, for the rain rate data, we know that when it rains on one location doesn't mean that it would also experience the same amount of rain or snow on the other location. Thus, having a lag of 20days of rain rate somewhat doesn't make sense. Overall, we can say that the lag of wind and rain rate is difference which shows no relationship between them.

8.After plotting, monthly average of the wind speed and rain rate for each site,

  What pattern do you see? (Graph for the average Wind and precipitation are shown on the next two following questions)
 
  For the OSSM data, the average wind speed goes starts going down from may and reached at the lowest on september. Then it keeps going back up and reached its highest point on January and slowly starts to decrease till april. On the other hand, the average rain rate starts going up from May until it reached the highest point of around 44mm/hr on semptember. Then it keeps going down until january and goes back up again. The two graphs seems to be related conversely, for instance, whent the lowest wind was on september, Average rain rate is the highest on the same month. This two graphs shows to have the same correlation. 
    
  For the OOSM data, the average wind speed started decreasing from May and reach its lowest point on september and reached its highest point point of 7.5m/s on January and started decreasing. On the other hand, the average rain rate starts increasing and reached its highest on september, then keeps going down to december and goes up and its lowest on April. The pattern is nor closely correlated but there are some point where we can see a conversely correlation between the two graphs. For instance, On september, the wind was at its lowest of 4mph while precipiation is at its highest at 45mm/hr. However, the pattern subsided on the following months.
  
  Which month had the highest and lowest rain rate? 
  
  For OSSM, the month of September experienced the highest average rain rate or precipitation. This make sense since this is the month when Summer ends, meaning more rains or precipitation starts coming in. Furthermore, the rain rate is at the lowest on the month of January.
  
  For OOSM, the average rain rate went up from may to june and stabilizes at around 45mm/hr until september then started decreasing till decemver to 15mm/hr. After that, the trend went up again to 40mm/hr on March and went to its lowest on April. This data shows that theres more rain or precipitation in the summer which doesnt make sense and then decreases on december.

  Which month had the highest and lowest wind speed?
  
  For OSSM, the month of september experienced the lowest wind of 3.5m/s during the fall and the highest on January 7 m/s during the winter when theres more rain or snow.
  
  For OOSM the average wind speed started at 6m/s on may and went to its lowest on september to roughly 4m/s and started going up to its highest on January to 7.5m/s. This make sense that on the month of January the wind is higher due to winter storms coming in from the ocean.

CONCLUSION:
  As a summary, this project has educate us on learning of handling big data and this time with the wind speed and rain rate at two different locations. It was found to be that Wind speed at two different location shows some corelation and that rain rate at different spots shows little correlation. This shows that at two different locations the wind blows with this much speed and will be experience from the other data recorder with somewhat the same speed. However, the amount of rain rate at one location doesn't necessarily mean it would also be the same on the other site.
